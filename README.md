Intrested in Full Stack Deep Learning position.


Developed my own product related to design and selection of vehicle/machine suspension system, a Full Stack web application in Django, everything in backend and frontend and in between.

Also developed a Full Stack Deep Learning Application.
Past experience in Mechanical Enginnering, vehicle development.

In the repositories, there are projects related to Deep Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA)(Leet Code), Full stack django, Feature Engineering, Reinforcement Learning and end-to-end implementation of the deep learning models in Django, Postgresql, Dockers.

Details about the Product: Automate the process of design and selection of the vibration absorption/ Suspension system of a vehicle or a machine, taking into consideration the various road conditions, like smoothness/or not, weight of the machine/vehicle, it's dimensions, external forces, velocity, generating computational graphic engines etc.


Date: 18/04/2021, projects to upload this week: YOLO, More of AutoEncoders, Style Transfer, Reinforcement Learning, OpenCV, REST Framework, Tiny ML.
